# Description
How often have we fallen into the norm of forgetting things in the young age?, In fact.. studies show that people aged 18 to 34 forget alot  (15%) than those above age 55(7%).  This has gone further into the levels of education and it is a mutation that had made the younger geneation of today not be too productive in schools. No more inventions ever exist, no more struggle as it were previously. This is the most fundamental reason as to why we came up with Bongo Doo application, that helps young people to think, enhance their brain and develope a bigger memory capacity.


Whats my goal here? 

"Memory is a record of your personal experience. It is a record of trial and error, defeat and success. Past failures will warn you against repeating them. "
-Wilfred Peterson

Our goal here is to enhance the momory of young people in a diverse way, a way to help them see wrong and good. To be able to recall their mentors, leaders,successes and failures. 15% of young people are prone to forgetting more much in this current society. This has ntern led to low levels of perfonces in schools, a scenario where students rely too much on their tutors during and even reasoning. This, for a devoping country means :no future innovations, no future outgoers, no future brighter minds and inventors.Kenya being our area of study, we realized that majority young people dont actually know and recall there leaders, this then gives them a hard experience requesting for resource allocation and funding for their proposals.

Bongodoo overcomes this problem by engaging users of the application in a more interactive way, a way that helps these young people to see,evaluate, think and remember. This game gives each individual user a timing from 60 seconds, 120 seconds and 180 seconds depending on the level of difficulty involved.

This gives more insights on the farmers side, They are able to do farming geared towards users preferences based on gender, times and tastes. This gives a further analysis of what the farmer should cncentrate on more in order to maximize the production value chain. Profits are maximized as customers interact directly with farmers and they can negotiate basing on users preferences. This helps farmers to have more confidence in their sales and will make farming in African countries have more value than as it is at the moment where lots os middle men kill the farming value chain.
